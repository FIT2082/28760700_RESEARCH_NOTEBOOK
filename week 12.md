This week we focused on the posters. The model was all assembled and working well however there were hiccups with the construction.

The current crude method of superbluing the acryllic together failed and the model was falling apart, we managed to keep it together with
blutack for the demonstration and presentation but in future revisions this model will need more focus on the acryllic side for
better construction.

The poster came out very well and was just a mix of out research spec and a description of our how our model works.
