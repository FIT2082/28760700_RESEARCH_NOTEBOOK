So we printed the model however the parts came out with morphed bases and the arches didn't print properly either.

I also converted my sketchup 2D model to Illustrator format and printed it with the correct scaling, and using these first 
printed pieces we could see that the scaling matched up.

However the pieces had to be reprinted but this time Matthew tried to put the "brim" feature on them, which creates a brim
around the base of the printing to prevent the pieces from warping when cooling.

We then also used the Illustrator floorplan to laser cut a piece of acryllic to place the pieces on. I had placed holes
in the design for the wires to come through under the holes in the 3D model. This plate was printed twice so we had 2 copies 
to sandwich the paper version in between.

The paper version was also reprinted this time with the holes for wires to pass through which I cut out using a knife.

The pieces all came out fine this time.

I cut 2 more shapes out of the paper on opposite sides so that they would be covered by the 3D pieces but allow the two
acryllic plates to stick to each other using superglue.

I then soldered pieces of wire onto pins and placed them into the holes.

The model ended up being too small as the pins were sticking out over the edges in many places and the model was also too small
for a finger to comfortable feel around the arches and the entrance to platform 12 and 13.

We aim to repreint the model at 1.5 scale then recreate all of this. Also this time we will use contrasting colours for the 
paper and pieces as that will be a huge help for those without complete blindess.

Now I need to design the rest of the model. This will be a case around the baseplate so that there is room underneath to place
the electronics but also so that we can create the stepdown to the platform. I will design the platforms in the flat layer 
representation talked of before as we do not have time to create the 3D representation.
