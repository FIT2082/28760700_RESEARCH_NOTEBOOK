I was assigned, along with my partner Ishan Joshi, to the 
â€œ3D Printing and Low Cost Electronics for the Creation of Accessible Graphics" project.
I was rather excited for this topic as I had worked on a similar thing a few years ago.
After meeting with Matthew Butler (the supervisor) we had a lot of information and a lot of thinking
to do about where we wanted this project to head.

This project was extremely open ended and could become virtually anything we wanted it to be, so no matter
how much planning we do now it is very likely that the final project ends up being something completely different.

Some background information for this project:
Matthew has been working on research for the Visually impared for quite some time now and has developed 3D printed maps for
visually impared people to feel and understand how to navidate around campus.

Our task is to work on a new topic or some extension of an already established project in order to further this overall
research into developing aids for the visually impared. 

Our current plan is to work on 3D printing a map of Southern Cross station, and incorperating it with an app we are to 
also develop in order to have an interactive map that visually impared visitors to the station can use as currently this station
is the only regional station in Melbourne city and is apparently an absolutely nightmare for the visually impared to navigate.

The research proposal is due in 2 weeks and Ishan and I have begun to brainstorm an overall topic for us to work on, with a draft
to hopefully give in to Matthew by Friday.
