We had a meeting with Matthew at Sensilab to see all the of toys we would be playing with as well as some of Matt's past work.
The core concept of our idea is to create a model which can be 3D printed in sections and then assembled onto a board,
with inserts for electronic sensors for the audio feedback. This proof of concept works in Matt's model of sensilab
and Caulfield campus and thus allows us far more clarity in how we would design our model.

As the reasearch specification is due soon, I begin drafting ideas for it:

The introduction would talk about the difficults vision impared people face in daily activities, and their current options for
help with those difficulties. It would move on to narrow in on our scope like how taking public transport is difficult, and then
end with a breif aim for our study describing our planned solution.

Background research would mostly be from the two previous papers Matthew had worked on, as much of our work will be
based on his. 

The aim is simply to develop a 3D printed aid which would assemble onto a surface, with integrated cheap electronics that would
allow the user to feel and learn the layout of Flinders Street Station and touch different points of interest for information
on said points.

We decided to go with Flinder Street since we want a railway station that isnt too simple and has lots of relevance
yet isn't overly complicated like Southern Cross with its slanted surrounding land and confusion floor arrangement.
