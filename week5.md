This week I begin learning sketch up and creating a crude plan.
My first attempt is to use a floor plan available on the internet at: http://www.hothousedesign.com.au/projects/map-of-flinders-street-station

I tried to look for other floormaps but could not find many sources with accurate detail, and had no
luck finding mobility maps either which would be a great help towards a simplified representation of the station.
So I would have to design a version myself.

With this I aim to have a floor plan created by the end of the week, however I cannot simply recreate this floorplan
as there are considerations for a balance between information loss and ease of readability.

Id most likely omit the smaller structures in the middle of the main floor area, as well as omit the retail sections
or simply make them the boundry of the floorspace as that may not be considered crucial information for traveling.

Stations 12 and 13 (also 11 since I can't find 11) would have to be emitted for now as it would be too complicated
but I would have to follow up on their importance, as if they are regional stations or some other station of importantance
that a vsiaually impared traveller or any traveller for that matter would need then I would have to devise some way
to incorperate them.

After this model is done I would attempt to print it and think of ways to disect it. Infact I may not even need to print much
as a simply sheet can be used for the floorspace. Instead of using actual staircases I would have the platforms and stations
be on the same level for now and use some representation for the escalators.

My final step for this section of the project would be to visit Flinders in person and evaluate the relative accuracy of my
model and determine if there are key pieces of information I forgot to include that become apparent only in person.

Futher research has allowed us to use another great model of Flinders from the same source as before: http://www.hothousedesign.com.au/projects/wayfinding-map
