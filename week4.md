The research specification is typed up and finalised for submission. We went with a Design Science 
approach for the methodology as per Matthew's suggestion, as its the best model of scientic study
which fits our current situation.

We have the methodology describe our planned steps for each of the aspects of our project, however all of these
may drastically change. But for the foreseable future we have steps which we plan to carry out, at the end of
which we would assess our solution (hopefully by week 9ish) and determine improvement through our own analysis,
to reset the design science cycle.

We don't exactly have time to assess our solution properly by actually implementing it however we can make a reasonable
analysis based on our background research / literature review.

We also found that an Andriod API for PTV exists which makes the scope of creating an App for interaction a possible reality.
I have begun practicing with google sketch up to revise the skills I had learned from my previous projects on it.

Next week I plan to create a model of Flinders and then go to the station in person to assess the accuracy of my model,
however I must also keep in mind that it doesnt just have to be accurate as there also needs to be some reasonable loss of 
information in order to keep a reasonble level of readability.
