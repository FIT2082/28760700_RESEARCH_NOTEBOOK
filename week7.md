This week my task was to create the final floorplan for which the main public area of the 
station is to be created from. This task proved more difficult than I thought as I had to survey
the station myself.

I began by going to Flinders Street Station and information the information desk of my intentions and ask for any possible
head starts such as pre-made floor plans. I was instructed to go see the stationmaster however the stationmaster could not
supply floorplans either for security concerns, however I was given permission to take survey of the station myself,
provided I stay within the area that the public is authorised to be in.

I began with a rough sketch to just get a feel of the outline:

I then created a sketch of the entrance room layout:

Finally I walked around the station for the rest of my day asking questions about the different platforms
and entrances to the staff to make sure I get all of the necessary information:

Few important things to note:
Platform 14 is often unused and therefore it may be acceptable to leave it out of the model. It is left reserved for special
events or as a backup.

Platform 12 and 10 are the same physical platform but simply split in 2, where 10 is 'above' the station and 12 is the portion
that runs 'below' (according to the above floorplan).

To access platform 12 and 13 by lift (key piece of detail) you must travel to platform 10 and then simply walk to the 13
side, coming back down towards 12 if you wish to get to 12.

Platform 1 and 14 are also the same platform in a similar situation to platform 10 and 12.

Now my task is to recreate this floorplan in some fitting software. Printing out the entire floorplan may be
inefficient and I may just have to print out the obstacles in the open area and maybe the walls. In that case
it might be best to create the floorplan in SketchUp as I can just create models of things I need to print straight away.


Floorplan Creation:
![Start](https://i.imgur.com/WwWVULI.png)
I begin with a blank canvas 300mm x 150mm. I feel as though this should be a sufficient size.

My first step was to make the entrance room, and with great difficulty I managed to get the shape to what I felt was right.
I did plan on using a hexagon shape and cut it up into fitting the room however from my personal surveying I felt that 
the room was not perfectly hexagonal and felt out of shape when alligned with a perfect hexagon, so I used trial and error
with lines to attempt to create the room. The picture below shows the attempt I was happy with and me having moved onto
creating the walls and pillars, the crucial bit of information for gaining entry for the visually impared.

My aim is to create the important structures that we need to place inside this canvas, and then simply print those
structures individually rather than printing the entire model as things such as the floor and boundary walls would better
be done as simple sheets of wood or acryllic.

The final floor plan looks as such:

Then I converted this floor plan to a 3D model:
