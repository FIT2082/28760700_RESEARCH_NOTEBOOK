My first task was to convert the latest 3D model I had back into a floorplan (could have used the floorplan from before
but just in case I forget any changes it's better to simply flatten my latest model).

Now I move on to making the printer friendly file.
I begin by isolating all of the pieces besides the floor and borders:

However as we can see from the underneath:

the models are hollow as they have been all 'raised up' from the original
floor plan, and for the 3D printer to recognise a solid object it needs all surfaces of the object to be covered.
This does not mean however that it will print a solid block of plastic, rather a light mesh inside to keep the models 
practical but still sturdy enough.

So after cleaning up all the imperfections and unnecessary lines in the model, I was left with the final
pieces that would form the inside of Parliment station.

After a lot of playing around I managed to fit all of the items in two files, both such that everything should
be within the printing limits of our printer.

Now I have to plan all of the POI's and then create holes for the touch sensors. For now I believe holes 
with a radius of 2.5mm should suffice.
