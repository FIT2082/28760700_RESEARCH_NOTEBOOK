We have troubles printing the scaled up model so we have decided to go with our current prototype and discuss the reasons
for why we wanted to scale up in the "Future work" section. We did get the scaled up version of the main entrance printed
so that can still be used to demonstration purposes, to prove that it is easier to navigate around.

I started off with simply raising the platform up and only have 3 walls in place so that the back side is open, as we plan to
leave that open for maintanence as well as have the ports for an I/O devices for the raspberryPi there.

I then created an area where I will draw out my plans for the platforms. I decided to not go with the 3D model representation 
I had originally planned on due to time constraints and so for now we have settled with a 3 layer acryllic design inspired from
one of Matt's previous models he had worked on.

So I will have one acryllic plate as the base plate for the station housing as well as the platform area, so one big piece.
Then there will be a layer of plates to create gaps for the tunnels. The last layer will be the platforms that run accross 
in their respective positions. The final combined drawing looks like this:

The tunnels are 15mm wide.
I then separated all of the pieces out and placed them in a print friendly format exported to PDF.

We got all of the pieces cut:

We did however get the side plates for the platform box cut 1cm higher as the original design drew concerns about whether or not
the electronics would fit comfortably inside.

Now I need to plan the stairs. I had not done this as I wasn't sure of the thickness of the plates. I have to consider the hieght
of the side plates plus the width of the two plates for the station floor. From that I minus the thickness of the two plates
for the tunnels and the platforms. As all of these pieces will be sitting on top of the baseplate I don't need to consider the
base plate.

The height of the box walls and platform floor combined is (5mm + 40mm) 45mm. The thickness of the 2 plates that the staircase
will sit on top of is 6mm, meaning the staircase will need a height of 39mm.
